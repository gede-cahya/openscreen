 *
 *   * There is no `source`. The ScreenCast portal raises its own picker and the
 *     compositor decides what it hands over; `desktopCapturer` on Wayland
 *     returns a single placeholder entry and no usable id. Passing one would be
 *     passing a guess. The helper reports back what was actually picked.
 *   * There is no `webcam`. Like macOS, the camera stays with the renderer's
 *     MediaRecorder — V4L2 in the helper would buy nothing and cost a second
 *     exclusive claim on the device.
 *
 * `restoreToken` is the one field with no equivalent elsewhere: the portal hands
 * one back after a successful session, and passing it next time is what stops
 * the picker from appearing on every single recording.
