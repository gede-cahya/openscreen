//! xdg-desktop-portal ScreenCast negotiation.
//!
//! The five-call dance is CreateSession → SelectSources → Start →
//! OpenPipeWireRemote, each async call answering on a Request object's Response
//! signal. ashpd subscribes to that signal before issuing the call, which is
//! the part that is easy to get wrong by hand (subscribe after, and the reply
//! can land before the match rule exists).
//!
//! Two properties of the protocol shape this module:
//!
//!   * SelectSources may be called ONCE per session. A second call fails with
//!     `Sources already selected`. Everything — cursor mode, source types,
//!     persistence — has to be decided before the first call.
//!   * Start is what raises the compositor's source picker. It does not return
//!     until a human has clicked, so nothing downstream may hold a timeout.
//!
//! ashpd is used rather than raw zbus because it is pure Rust (no libdbus-1-dev)
//! and because its `pipewire` feature — which would drag in pipewire-rs and
//! therefore libpipewire-0.3-dev — is deliberately left off; the PipeWire half
//! lives in csrc/pw_shim.c instead.
